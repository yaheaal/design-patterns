# 🐍 Python Design Patterns 🎨

Welcome to the Python Design Patterns repository! 🎉

Design patterns are a set of proven solutions to common problems in software development. They provide a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. The design patterns are like templates that can be applied to various situations in software development.

This repository is a collection of design patterns implemented in Python with examples. Here you can learn about the most common design patterns and understand how to apply them in your Python projects. 💡

# Why Do We Use Design Patterns? 🤔
* Proven Solutions: Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software development, which means they have already been tested and implemented successfully.
* Reusable Code: Design patterns promote reusable code, making it easier to maintain and modify the codebase.
* Better Collaboration: Design patterns provide a common vocabulary that can be used to communicate with other developers, making it easier to collaborate.

# Types of Design Patterns 🎭
Design patterns can be classified into three main categories:

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns provide a way to create objects in a controlled manner. These patterns help in reducing complexity and making code more modular. Examples include:
* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Builder

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns provide a way to organize objects and classes to form larger structures. These patterns help in making the code more flexible and maintainable. Examples include:
* Adapter
* Decorator
* Facade

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns provide a way to manage the behavior of objects and classes. These patterns help in reducing coupling and increasing the flexibility of the code. Examples include:
* Observer
* Strategy
* Template Method
